# AI-Powered Military Fabric Selection Platform

Empowering military uniform procurement with **AI/ML-driven tools** for intelligent fabric recommendations, sustainability scoring, and supplier analytics.

***

## Overview

This platform leverages artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics to optimize the selection of fabrics for military uniforms. Users can compare materials, assess environmental impact, and receive tailored recommendations based on climate and operational needs.[11][10]

***

## Core Features

- **AI/ML Recommendations**  
  Get fabric suggestions based on climate, operational requirements, and performance criteria.[14][10]

- **Comprehensive Database**  
  Search and filter fabrics by composition, durability, comfort, weather resistance, and more. All entries include detailed supplier, pricing, and availability data.[12][13]

- **Sustainability Scoring**  
  Evaluate materials by recyclability, biodegradability, and sustainability scores using curated environmental impact data.[11]

- **Supplier Comparison**  
  Instantly compare suppliers for price, location, minimum order quantity, and available inventory.[12]

- **Performance Ratings**  
  Review fabrics and suppliers by durability, comfort, weather resistance, sustainability, and affordability.[13]

- **Climate-Specific Blends**  
  Access curated blends for various climatic conditions and mission profiles.[14]
